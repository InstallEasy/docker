# Installation docker for Linux OS

Sometimes i have problem to do all instructions from official site of docker for installation
Now i create this script who will recognize Linux OS and do installation and configuration

`
- Debian
- Ubuntu
- CentOS
- Fedora ( coming soon )
`

Everything you need to do is just start the `script.sh` and script will do everythin else
Just enjoy
