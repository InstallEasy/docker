About Docker:

Docker is software that provides containers, which allows teams to emulate development environments. Docker began as an internal project, initially developed by dotCloud engineers.

About Docker-Compose:

![Docker Compose](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/compose/master/logo.png)

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your application's services. Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. To learn more about all the features of Compose see the list of features.

Compose is great for development, testing, and staging environments, as well as CI workflows. You can learn more about each case in Common Use Cases.

Using Compose is basically a three-step process.
